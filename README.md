# BEWARE THIS CODE IS NOT COMPLETE, I WOULD UPLOAD EACH CHAPTER EXERCISES AS I FINISH THEM.

# Eloquent JavaScript Exercise Solutions.
## The book with all the exercise and content can be fount at https://eloquentjavascript.net/
#### Hi there :octocat:, thanks for checking my code, if you find any :bug: or just want to ask or comment something, please contact me! i will be happy :smile: to replay!
## I do not own any rights on this content, and this use is for personal and learning purepose, I recomend reading the chapters of the book ahead of doing the exercise but if you are fluent on codeing and want to go for it I leave bellow all the articulations of the exercises from the book.

## Here you can find some of the Eloquent Javascript book exercise solutions, this solutions are my own version, some of them use things that are not introduce until chapters ahead but since I knew about them ahead I used them to solve some problems in a cleaner way, the solutions are therefor different from the solutions given by the author at https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/

## CHAPTER 2 EXERCISES:
**********************************************************************************

### ① -Looping a triangle
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

    #
    ##
    ###
    ####
    #####
    ######
    #######

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

let abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// → 3


### ② -FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).


### ③ -Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

     # # # #
    # # # # 
     # # # #
    # # # # 
     # # # #
    # # # # 
     # # # #
    # # # # 

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CHAPTER 3 EXERCISES:
**********************************************************************************

### ① -Minimum
The previous chapter introduced the standard function Math.min that returns its smallest argument. We can build something like that now. Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

### ② -Recursion
We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

Zero is even.

One is odd.

For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.

Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?

### ③ -Bean counting
You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N]. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.

Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CHAPTER 4 EXERCISES:
**********************************************************************************

### ① -The sum of a range
The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:

console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.

Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does indeed return 55.

As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the array. If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].

### ② -Reversing an array
Arrays have a reverse method that changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. The first, reverseArray, takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: it modifies the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the standard reverse method.

Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in the previous chapter, which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations? Which one runs faster?

### ③ -A list
Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures. A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with array). A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on.

The resulting objects form a chain, like this:

let list = {
  value: 1,
  rest: {
    value: 2,
    rest: {
      value: 3,
      rest: null
    }
  }
};

A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. For example, if I create two new values {value: 0, rest: list} and {value: -1, rest: list} (with list referring to the binding defined earlier), they are both independent lists, but they share the structure that makes up their last three elements. The original list is also still a valid three-element list.

Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument. Also write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper function prepend, which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no such element.

If you haven’t already, also write a recursive version of nth.

### ④ -Deep comparison
The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes you’d prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.

Write a function deepEqual that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.

To find out whether values should be compared directly (use the === operator for that) or have their properties compared, you can use the typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account: because of a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".

The Object.keys function will be useful when you need to go over the properties of objects to compare them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CHAPTER 5 EXERCISES:
**********************************************************************************

### ① -Flattening
Use the reduce method in combination with the concat method to “flatten” an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the original arrays.

### ② -Your own loop
Write a higher-order function loop that provides something like a for loop statement. It takes a value, a test function, an update function, and a body function. Each iteration, it first runs the test function on the current loop value and stops if that returns false. Then it calls the body function, giving it the current value. Finally, it calls the update function to create a new value and starts from the beginning.

When defining the function, you can use a regular loop to do the actual looping.

### ③ -Everything
Analogous to the some method, arrays also have an every method. This one returns true when the given function returns true for every element in the array. In a way, some is a version of the || operator that acts on arrays, and every is like the && operator.

Implement every as a function that takes an array and a predicate function as parameters. Write two versions, one using a loop and one using the some method.

### ④ -Dominant writing direction
Write a function that computes the dominant writing direction in a string of text. Remember that each script object has a direction property that can be "ltr" (left to right), "rtl" (right to left), or "ttb" (top to bottom).

The dominant direction is the direction of a majority of the characters that have a script associated with them. The characterScript and countBy functions defined earlier in the chapter are probably useful here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CHAPTER 6 EXERCISES:
**********************************************************************************

### ① -A vector type
Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It takes x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to properties of the same name.

Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors’ (this and the parameter) x and y values.

Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the length of the vector—that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).

### ② -Groups
The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called Set. Like an instance of Map, a set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map, it does not associate other values with those—it just tracks which values are part of the set. A value can be part of a set only once—adding it again doesn’t have any effect.

Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds a value to the group (but only if it isn’t already a member), delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.

Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine whether two values are the same.

Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating over it.

### ③ -Iterable groups
Make the Group class from the previous exercise iterable. Refer to the section about the iterator interface earlier in the chapter if you aren’t clear on the exact form of the interface anymore.

If you used an array to represent the group’s members, don’t just return the iterator created by calling the Symbol.iterator method on the array. That would work, but it defeats the purpose of this exercise.

It is okay if your iterator behaves strangely when the group is modified during iteration.

### ④ -Borrowing a method
Earlier in the chapter I mentioned that an object’s hasOwnProperty can be used as a more robust alternative to the in operator when you want to ignore the prototype’s properties. But what if your map needs to include the word "hasOwnProperty"? You won’t be able to call that method anymore because the object’s own property hides the method value.

Can you think of a way to call hasOwnProperty on an object that has its own property by that name?
